# Motionbuilder-Scripts
This contains all of my smaller projects, and quality of life scripts.

## Setup
To use these modules, you need to import the folder which contains these modules by placing the `setup/paths.py` script into:

`C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\MB\[MB-VERSION]-x64\config\PythonStartup`

This will add that folder to Motionbuilder's startup sequence.
